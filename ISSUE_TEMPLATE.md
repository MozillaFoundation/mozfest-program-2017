Please do not submit session proposals directly through Github. Instead, submit your session through the [Call For Proposals form](https://mozillafestival.org/proposals).

If you submit your session directly through Github it will not receive the unique identifiers required for the curation process and inclusion in the final schedule. 

Thanks,
The MozFest Team
